# Homework 0: Getting Started with GitHub Classroom ðŸš€

## Welcome to DCS109!

**Due:** Monday, 9/8 @ 5PM  
**Points:** 1  
**Time Estimate:** ~1 hour

### Why This Assignment Exists ðŸ¤”
- To familiarize you with the Codespaces/GitHub workflow, so that in future assignments you can focus on coding, not how to submit work
- To give you a reason to collaborate with your classmates and start getting to know them

---

## Plan for the assignment
- Work in groups of 2-3. Collaboration/discussion is encouraged, but for grading purposes (and for you to get the most out of this assignment) you'll need to submit your own work. 
- This is meant to be a friendy "follow-along, and do the exercises" type of assignment. It's more of an 'exercise' than an assignment, but I'm making it worth one point so there's some motivation to work slowly and carefully. 

## What we'll learn today: 
- How to open up an assignment as a repo. 
- How to build a **codespace** (the environment where you'll do your work)
- How to navigate around VSCode (the code editor running inside your codespace) and use it for some simple tasks, including: running programs and tests, editing files, doing **version control**.
- How to do some very basic things at the command line terminal (like run and test code)
- How to make **comments** in code. 
- How to recognize **syntax errors** vs. **specification errors**

## Your Tasks
Today you'll go through all the important parts of our project workflow. The assignment sheet makes it look like there's a lot, but basically we're just going to: 

1. open a python file 
2. modify that file
3. save that file
4. **commit** changes to that file
5. execute the file in python
6. run tests on the code in the file
7. sync that file to our repo (which will also submit the assignment)

Let's get to it!
